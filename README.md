# Web MonteCarlo simulator for project viability analysis

This project was developed during an internship as a software developer at UFSC (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina) during my undergraduate studies in Automation and Control Engineering. The main objective was to provide students, professors, and researchers with a powerful tool for analyzing project viability in terms of profit, time, and other key factors.

Since commercial project analysis tools are often expensive, this initiative aimed to democratize access to such resources for the public, making it possible for academic and research communities to conduct complex analyses without the need for costly software. The web-based platform also enhances accessibility, allowing users to run simulations and assess the feasibility of projects remotely, contributing to more informed decision-making in various fields.

The website is fully operational in UFSC's public server. With that in mind, and considering that such simulations can involve a huge amount of data, the majority of data manipulations are done via frontend, leaving only the random number generation and basic file access being done in backend.
